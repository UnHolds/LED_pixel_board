## Chips

* 16-channel dual-buffer const current LED driver
	* IC: FM6124DJ NGN475000 
	* Num: 6
* 8-channel LED display line scan blanking control driver chip
	* IC: TC7262FJ NHT025000
	* Num: 4
* 32MBit 3.3V Flash
	* IC: MB2449 25VQ32DTJG 
	* But maybe: XM25QH32C
	* Num: 1

LEDS = 32x32


Led Driver max lines: 16 * 6 = 96  (96 / 32 = 3)

Maybe 32 Lines per color?

Scan Line = 8 * 4 = 32

## Chips maybe 
* STM32WB

Closing the S1 switch against Ground rotates the image.
